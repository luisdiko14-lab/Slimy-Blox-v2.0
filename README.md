# 🕹️ ADMIN WORLD 🕹️

## 🚀 Overview
**ADMIN WORLD** is a retro-themed, multiplayer arcade game where every player is automatically granted **Owner** status. Built with a terminal-style cyberpunk aesthetic, it features real-time interaction, admin commands, and a Nintendo-inspired "boot sequence" loading screen. 👾

## ✨ Project Vision
- **👑 Multiplayer Admin Fun**: A world where everyone has the power to `/kick`, `/kill`, and `/announce`.
- **📟 Retro Aesthetic**: CRT scanlines, pixel fonts, and glitch effects for a nostalgic 80s/90s terminal feel.
- **⚡ Low Friction**: Instant guest access or Replit Auth for permanent identities.

## 👤 User Preferences
- **🗣️ Communication**: Simple, everyday language.
- **🎨 Style**: Cyberpunk/Terminal aesthetic with high contrast (Neon on Black).
- **📱 Features**: Mobile-friendly D-pad controls visible on all devices.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 💻 Frontend (client/src/)
- **⚛️ Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript.
- **🎮 Game Engine**: Custom `requestAnimationFrame` loop in `GameWorld.tsx`.
- **🛠️ UI & Components**: 
  - `shadcn/ui` primitives for interface elements.
  - `framer-motion` for smooth UI transitions and glitch effects.
  - `Tailwind CSS` for utility-based styling.
- **📊 State Management**:
  - `React Query` for backend logs.
  - `useState/useRef` for high-frequency game state (positioning, entities).

### 🖥️ Backend (server/)
- **🟢 Runtime**: Node.js with Express and TypeScript.
- **🌐 Real-time**: WebSocket (`ws`) server for player synchronization, chat broadcasting, and command execution.
- **🗄️ Persistence**: 
  - PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM.
  - Command logs stored for auditing and leaderboard purposes.

### ⚙️ Key Game Systems
- **⌨️ Command System**: Supports `/kick`, `/kill`, `/tp`, `/speed`, `/size`, `/fly`, `/god`, and `/announce`.
- **🎯 Targeting**: Commands like `/kick` support specific player names or `@everyone`.
- **🔄 Redirection**: Terminated/Kicked sessions redirect to custom static pages (`kicked.html`, `killed.html`) in the `public/` directory.
